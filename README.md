# Speech-Analysis
Python implementation of MFCC feature extraction and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) for comparing two audio signals

Features:

Loads two audio files and computes their Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs)
Computes the similarity between the two signals using the Euclidean distance between their MFCCs
Uses Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to find the optimal alignment between the two signals
Plots the similarity matrix and the DTW alignment path
